                <p>The player's goal is to advance along the game's trophy road, participate in battles with other players, and also discover and improve new game characters with unique abilities and characteristics.

                    The gameplay focuses on defeating a team of other players, or an AI opponent, alone, in a team of two, or in co-op with three or five people, in a variety of game modes. Players can choose characters, each of which has their own skills and superpowers. Characters can be obtained in the in-game store for credits, and gadgets, star powers and equipment can be purchased for coins.</p>

                <p>Clash is a Battle Royale mode with no time limits. There are 2 types of mode - singles and doubles. In a singles encounter, the last survivor among 10 players wins, and in a doubles encounter, the last surviving team of 2 players among 5 teams (also 2 players each) wins. Scattered around the map are boxes with power-up cubes that increase the player's health and damage, and over time the map will narrow towards the center with poisonous clouds, causing increasing damage to players every second.</p>

                 Brawlball is a 3 vs 3 player mode where the main task is to score 2 goals against the opponents by controlling a special ball for this. If the second goal is not scored, the team with the larger score wins. If we take into account equality, then the player is given 1 minute to score a goal, but the obstacles on the map will be destroyed. If neither team is able to score during extra time, then the player will be given a tie's pass.    
                </p>
                <p> Knockout is a 3 vs 3 player mode where the main task is to win two rounds, each of which lasts a maximum of 1 minute. The team that has no players left or has fewer players left than the opposite team loses, but if after time expires there are equal players in both teams, the team that caused more damage wins the round.</p>
